# AnalogHotKey
Another Arduino thingy I guess... Turns an Arduino with native USB into a MIDI/HID device using an Arduino Pro Micro/Leonardo.

Built in less than 24 hours as a birthday present. Sorry if it's buggy but you can fix it!

SketchUp 2017 model is included.
3mm Acrylic used as the body, cut with a laser. SVG file included.
Arduino Code is included.
